# Day 2
## Talk 1 JF Brenncke Texas
Facilitated transport in ionic liquids for CO2/N2 membrane separations. 
Selectivity depends on CO2/Ionic liquid affinity. 

Olein paraffin separation facilitated diffusion

Isoporous membranes

## Talk 2 Susannah Scott UCSB

are simulations evidence? 
That's Philosophy. 

## Katie Li-Oakey Wyoming

Molecular interactions to design materials.
From ETH, as well. 

## Schwartz - University of Colorado, Boulder

Mass transport in liquid-filled void spaces (in membranes)

Effective hole size, confined diffusion. 


## Marta Hatzell - Georgia Tech 

Ammonia synthesis catalysis
